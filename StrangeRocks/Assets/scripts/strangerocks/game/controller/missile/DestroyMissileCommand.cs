//A Missile can be destroyed in one of two ways:
//1. It can strike something (rock, enemy, player, another missile.
//2. It can fly offscreen.

//We're using pooling, so Missiles are never really "destroyed". We just move
//them offscreen and reset them until we need one again. This is more memory
//and performance friendly than the constant creation/destruction of Objects.
