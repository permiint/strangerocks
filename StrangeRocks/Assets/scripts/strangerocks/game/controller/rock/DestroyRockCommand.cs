//A Rock is destroyed if it is struck by a player missile.
//It may also get removed during cleanup when re-starting the game.

//One could make a pretty good argument that this Command should in fact be broken into three:
//1. Tabulate points.
//2. Destroy the Rock.
//3. Determine if the level is complete.

//I chose not to do that in this case (a bit lazy, to be honest). If I did, it would be a fairly simple matter,
//and probably better, since I'd be doing the single-responsibility thing far more cleanly.
//In the GameContext, I'd re-write the binding something like this:

//Currently:
//commandBinder.Bind<DestroyRockSignal>().To<DestroyRockCommand>().Pooled();

//Rewritten:
//commandBinder.Bind<DestroyRockSignal>()
//		.To<ScoreByRockCommand>()
//		.To<DestroyRockCommand>()
//		.To<CheckLevelEndCommand>()
//		/InSequence()
//		.Pooled();
