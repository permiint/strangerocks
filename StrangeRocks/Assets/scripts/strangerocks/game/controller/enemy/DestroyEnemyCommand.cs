//An Enemy can be destroyed in one of three ways:
//1. The player's missile can strike it, earning the player points.
//2. The Enemy can fly offscreen.
//3. The Enemy may simply be cleaned up if left behind at the end of a level.

//We're using pooling, so Enemies are never really "destroyed". We just move
//them offscreen and reset them until we need one again. This is more memory
//and performance friendly than the constant creation/destruction of Objects.
